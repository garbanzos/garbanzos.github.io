A while back, I tried the problems in [PicoCTF 2014][picoctf]. One of the problems I tried was on web exploitation so I decided to share my thought process as I go about solving this problem. 

#### **The Problem** 

**Potentially Hidden Password - 100**<br>
This [Daedalus Corp. website][daedalus] loads images in a rather odd way... [[Source Code]][source-code]

**Hint**<br>
The 'file_loader.php' page might be able to serve more than just images.
 
#### **The Thought Process**
When I open the website I saw this: 

![daedalus]({{ site.url }}/assets/daedalus.PNG)


Naturally, as this is a CTF problem, I tried to explore the website. I tried to click around and various things like getting the images' address and visiting it. One of the images had an address: {% highlight text %} http://web2014.picoctf.com/potentially-hidden-password-3878213/file_loader.php?file=zone1.jpg{% endhighlight %} and visiting the link just showed the image. There was nothing out of the ordinary so I continued to examine the other resource provided by the question - the source code. After examining the code, I found that there is this part of the code that seems to access the flag file: 

{% highlight php %}
<?php
  $config_file = fopen("/resources/config/admin_mode.config", "r");
  if (fgets($config_file) === "true") {
    $flag_file = fopen("/resources/secrets/flag", "r");
	echo fgets($flag_file);
	flose($flag_file);
  }
  fclose($config_file);
?>
{% endhighlight %}

Since the hint mentioned images, I also looked out for the portion where the images are added: 

{% highlight html %}
<h2>Daedalus Headquarters</h2>
<p>Our wonderful headquarters has many awesome rooms!</p>
<center>
  <img src="file_loader.php?file=zone1.jpg" class="zone"/>
  <img src="file_loader.php?file=zone2.jpg" class="zone"/>
  <img src="file_loader.php?file=zone3.jpg" class="zone"/><br><br>
  <img src="file_loader.php?file=zone4.jpg" class="zone"/>
  <img src="file_loader.php?file=zone5.jpg" class="zone"/>
  <img src="file_loader.php?file=zone6.jpg" class="zone"/><br>
</center>
{% endhighlight %}

Previously, I managed to access the first image by adding ```file_loader.php?file=zone1.jpg``` to the url of the website so I thought maybe we can access the flag file in the same way. Hence, I replaced ```zone1.jpg``` with ```flag```. After hitting enter, I got directed to web page that says:  
{% highlight text %}
No such file: /resources/files/flag
{% endhighlight %}

Unfortunately, my first guess was incorrect. However, I managed to gain some information from this attempt. It seems that the images are stored in the directory ```/resources/files/``` and we know from the source code that the path of the flag is ```/resources/secrets/flag```. Hence, the flag file and the images are stored in different directories - the reason why my first approach didn't work.  

#### **The Solution**
With all the information gathered, all we need to do now is to navigate to the flag file. Firstly, we need to traverse to the parent directory ```\resources``` then go into the ```secrets``` folder. Luckily, the website is vulnerable to the directory traversal attack (aka dot dot slash attack) so we can access the flag file by 
{% highlight text %} http://web2014.picoctf.com/potentially-hidden-password-3878213/file_loader.php?file=../secrets/flag {% endhighlight %}

And viola! I got the flag: ```i_like_being_included```.
